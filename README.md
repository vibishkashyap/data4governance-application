TIC TAC TOE GAME- ORIGINAL

This is the implementation of the classic tic tac toe game(1 Player, with the comupter being the other player) in Python. Built on Python 3, it can be played on the command prompt. The 3x3 board will be printed, with position values for "o" are to be inputted (Player-o) and the computer auto fills "x" in a different place after the player's turn. At the end it is also announces the winner or if the game is tied.

ALGORITHM OF THE PROGRAM:
1. Start, import random module.
2. Print the 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game board.
3. Print that the player is 'o' and that the computer is 'x'
4. Begin a for loop, for j in range of 9 and input the position value from the user.
5. Use nested conditional statements to check which row of the table the player inputs a value, to check if or not a value pre-exists at a position, and to add the the value to the position inputted by the user.
6. Use if- else statements to check for the winning conditions for the player.
7. For the computer to generate its position values in 3x3 tic tac toe board, use the randint function.
8. Similarly like for user inputted values, use nested conditional statements to input the computer value in a non occupied position.
9. Use if- else staements to check for the winning conditions for the computer.
10. Use empty variables to count and check for winner.
11. Print the winner of the game or 'game- tied'

WHY DID I CHOOSE THIS PROJECT?

I learnt python as an elective course and have been able to learn the basics of python- working with different data types, conditional statements, simple functions and applications. This project was wholly done by myself, learning from my mistalkes and rightly encapsulates my understanding of python. I have been learning python for data analytics and data science in my time at home off late and have just begun to work on simple projects relating to them. Through the fellowship, I hope to learn the unexplored and interesting features of python to use in data science.
